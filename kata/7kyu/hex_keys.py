# Hector the hacker has stolen some information, but it is encrypted. In order to decrypt it, he needs to write a
# function that will generate a decryption key from the encryption key which he stole (it is in hexadecimal). To do
# this, he has to determine the two prime factors P and Q of the encyption key, and return the product (P-1) * (Q-1).
#
# Note: the primes used are < 105
# Examples
#
# For example if the encryption key is "47b", it is 1147 in decimal. This factors to 31*37, so the key Hector needs
# is 1080 (= 30*36).
#
# More examples:
#
#     input: "2533", result: 9328 (primes: 89, 107)
#     input: "1ba9", result: 6912 (primes: 73, 97)


def find_key(encryption_key):
    n = int(encryption_key, 16)
    return next((k - 1) * ((n // k) - 1) for k in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1) if n % k == 0)


# Basic Tests
print(find_key("47b"))  # 1080  (primes: 31, 37)
print(find_key("2533"))  # 9328 (primes: 89, 10)
print(find_key("1ba9"))  # 6912  (primes: 73, 97)
